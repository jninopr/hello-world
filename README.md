# hello-world
I'm just learning to use GitHub :)

Hello. I'm Jos√©.  tbh I'm a psychology student  from Venezuela. 

So, Wtf is doing a psychology student in GitHub? 
Well, for investigation i'm doing a specialization in Data's Siencies. So, i need to use this tool :)

I like programing btw. The only reason why I did not study computer science is because we have many in my family.
I guess I have somehow tried to combine everything I like. That's why a psychology studen is here :) 

Oh, my english is not very good. Maybe you already noticed it.
